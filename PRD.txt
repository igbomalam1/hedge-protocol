**Product Requirements Document (PRD) – TRACE Website**  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** February 2026  
**Project Name Placeholder:** TRACE (Trace Rewards for On-Chain Activity) – replace with final name later  
**Tagline:** “Your on-chain history echoes forever. Trace it. Earn for it.”  

### 1. Executive Summary
TRACE is a simple, beautiful web3 claim site that scans a user’s wallet history across chains, scores their past activity, and lets them claim $TRACE tokens as a reward.  

It feels exactly like the Uniswap, Optimism, or Arbitrum airdrop pages — clean, fast, no friction.  

Goal: Launch an MVP in 1–2 weeks that lets real users connect, see their “legacy score,” and claim tokens on Base (or chosen chain).  

### 2. Business Objectives
- Reward genuine on-chain users (not farmers)  
- Create instant community & virality (“I just claimed 2,400 TRACE for my old txs!”)  
- Collect wallet data (anonymously) to understand real usage patterns  
- Drive token distribution fairly and transparently  

### 3. Target Users & Personas
- **OG DeFi user** (25–40 yo, 100+ txs, multiple chains)  
- **NFT collector** (mints, flips, holds)  
- **Base/Arbitrum daily user** in emerging markets (low gas focus)  
- **Sybil hunter** (we will block with min volume/age thresholds)  

### 4. Core Features (MVP Priority)

#### Phase 1 – MVP (Launch Week)
1. **Landing Page**  
   - Hero: Big “Connect Wallet” button + tagline  
   - Trust signals: “Powered by Moralis • On Base • 100% on-chain”  
   - Teaser: “Over 12,000 wallets already eligible”

2. **Wallet Connection** (RainbowKit + Wagmi)  
   Modern modal with popular wallets (MetaMask, Rainbow, Coinbase, WalletConnect, etc.)





3. **Dashboard – Activity Summary**  
   After connect → instant scan (Moralis Wallet History endpoint)  
   Cards shown:  
   - Wallet age (first tx date)  
   - Total transactions  
   - Total volume swapped  
   - Protocols interacted (Uniswap, Aave, etc.)  
   - Chains active on  
   - Your TRACE Score (e.g., 2,847 points → 2,847 $TRACE)  
   - Beautiful activity timeline/feed






4. **Reward Breakdown** (transparent formula)  
   Example scoring (customizable later):  
   - 1 tx = 1 point  
   - $100 volume = +10 points  
   - Interacted with 5+ protocols = +500 bonus  
   - Wallet >6 months old = +1,000  
   - Max cap per wallet to prevent abuse

5. **Claim Flow**  
   - “You are eligible for 3,240 $TRACE”  
   - “Claim” button → signs message or uses Merkle proof  
   - Success screen with shareable tweet card





#### Phase 2 – Post-Launch (Week 2–4)
- Multi-chain support (Base + Arbitrum + ETH)  
- Leaderboard of top legacy wallets  
- “Refer a friend” (bonus for both)  
- Admin dashboard to update scoring rules without redeploy

### 5. Technical Requirements
**Frontend**  
- Next.js 14 (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind  
- Wagmi + RainbowKit + Viem  
- Zustand or Jotai for state  

**Data Layer**  
- Moralis Wallet History API (one call = full enriched history)  
- Optional: Alchemy / Covalent fallback  

**Smart Contract**  
- ERC-20 token  
- Claim function (Merkle tree preferred – cheap gas)  
- Or simple server-signed claim (faster MVP)  

**Backend (minimal)**  
- Vercel Serverless functions for:  
  - Moralis API proxy (hide key)  
  - Merkle proof generation  
  - Claim signature (if not on-chain)  

**Hosting**  
- Vercel (free tier perfect)  
- Custom domain later (trace.xyz or similar)

### 6. UI/UX Guidelines
- Dark mode only (crypto standard)  
- Neon accents (green/purple)  
- One-page feel after connect  
- Mobile-first & responsive  
- Loading states: “Scanning 3,284 transactions…” with progress bar  
- Copy must be fun & clear (e.g., “Your 2023 degen moves just paid off”)

Reference designs (use these as moodboard):
- Optimism claim page  
- Uniswap airdrop modal  
- Modern wallet dashboards (Nansen, Zerion, Capsule style)

### 7. Non-Functional Requirements
- Load time < 4 seconds after connect  
- Privacy: Never store private keys or full history server-side  
- Rate limiting & anti-sybil (min 50 txs + $500 volume + wallet age >90 days)  
- Gas: User only pays claim gas (~$0.10–0.50 on Base)  
- Security: Rate-limit Moralis calls, validate inputs, audit contract

### 8. Success Metrics (First 30 Days)
- 5,000+ unique wallet connections  
- 2,000+ claims  
- >30% of visitors claim  
- Viral coefficient >1.2 (shareable results)  
- Zero major bugs or exploit reports  

### 9. Risks & Mitigations
- API costs → Moralis free tier + caching  
- Sybil attacks → strict scoring + optional zk-proof later  
- Name conflict → we can change branding in 1 day  

### 10. Next Steps (Action List)
1. Finalize name + ticker + domain (today)  
2. Deploy token contract (Remix or Foundry)  
3. Set up Moralis account + get API key  
4. Scaffold Next.js + RainbowKit repo  
5. Build dashboard page (I can give you the full code next)  
6. Decide scoring formula together  

This PRD is ready to hand to a dev or use yourself.  

Want me to:  
- Generate the actual Next.js starter code?  
- Write the exact Moralis + Wagmi integration snippet?  
- Create the Solidity claim contract?  
- Design the Figma wireframes?  

Just say the word and we ship this thing this week. 🚀  

What part do you want to tackle first?
